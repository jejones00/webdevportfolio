     <p> Something I am super excited about is the fact that I graduate this spring, and I will finally be done with all the hard work I have put in over the past 3 years being at Columbia. Something I am not super excited about is student loans which will be hitting soon after. Laslty, something I would reccomend is taking some time for yourself everyday. It is easy to get lost in the chaos of our daily lives. Things I am working on implementing to be my best version of myself is cooking, and lifting weights!
