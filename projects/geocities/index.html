  <h2>I have been obsessed with John Hughes movies for as long as I can remember here's why: </h2>
  
  
  <main>
   <h3>Some Background:</h3>
    <p>John Hughes was a movie director that created some of the most iconic teen movies to date. Although now there is defiently some controversy surrounding his films, he created a lasting impact on a very broad amount of generations. Somehow John Hughes embodied the teenage expirence and created pieces and stories which will most likely last a lifetime. He was always there when I needed him, his films seeming to solve every issue while it felt like a warm inviting hug. </p>

    <h3> John Hughes created 32 films; Here are just some you may know of:</h3>
    <p>
     “Pretty in Pink” (1986, w)

    <p>
      
    <h3> Most of his films were even filmed in Chicago and the Chicago Subarbs</h3>
    
    <p> Although John Hughes was originally from Lansing, Michigan (which I am from Battle Creek, Michigan. Funny Right?) He worked and lived in the Chicago area when he first ebgan writing movie scripts during his corporate job. So when you watch one of his films next make sure you track the locations so you can see them for yourself! </p>

    <h3> My personal favorites are "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", "Sixteen Candles", "Home Alone" and "Uncle Buck", but you cannot go wrong with any of these amazing films. Enjoy your movie night!
