        <h3 id= "trend1">Parachute Pants</h3>
        <p>As we look at what celebrities are wearing my eye has been drawn to the trending streetwear style choices. One of these in particular being parachute pants. Given that we have already seen the cargo pant comback, it is only expected that these are what will be all the rage this fall. We can already see that A-list celebrities are wearing them. </p>

        <h3>Bold Bold Prints and Colors</h3>
        <p>With the recent surge of Harry Styles fans we have seen more Kamp outfits than almost ever before. Making fashion more bold, bright, and risky. I believe that we will see this translate over into fall fashion as we still cool down. Alot of extra outfits, whether that be through layering, color, or bold patterns we will see it all!</p>
